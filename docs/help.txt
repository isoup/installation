Usage:
    ./ins.h [-h] [-v openstack_releasename] rolenames

This script help you to install specific openstack roles to the machine,
before run the script, you need to update the environment variables in the
head of the script according to your setup.

Prerequisites:
    1) All nodes should be able to access internet to install related packages,
       make sure the DNS and the network have been set properly before run
       the scripts.

options:
    -h  this help
    -v  assign an openstack version to be installed, currently supported
        Openstack version are: "SUPPORTED_OPENSTACK_RELEASE"
        the default openstack version is "LATEST_OPENSTACK_RELEASE"

rolenames:
    The rolenames could be any one or combo of the follow role set.
    a) Openstack all-in-one installation role name list:
        allinone

    b) Openstack multi-nodes installation role name list:
        controller
        network
        compute

    c) Openstack component installation role name list:
        database
        mq
        dashboard
        keystone
        glance
        nova_ctrl
        nova_compute
        neutron_ctrl
        neutron_compute
        neutron_network
        cinder_ctrl

    Examples:
        # Install all openstack stuff(allinone role) in one machine
        ./ins.sh -v mitaka allinone

        # Install two roles(nova controller and neutron controller), if no
        # specific version(-v) means to install the latest supported version.
        ./ins.sh nova_ctrl neutron_ctrl

        # Install Openstack with fortinet plugins
        a) Before run the script, a fortigate need to be set up properly:
           1) license activated
           2) enabled multi-vdom
           3) At least there are 3 ports in the fortigate:
                 I) a port for management, need to have a ip address
                 II) a port for openstack tenant network
                 III) a port for openstack external network.

        b) Customize the local.conf file before run ins.sh
            ############## EXAMPLE local.conf #################
            # openstack config
            CTRL_MGMT_IP=10.160.37.80
            INTERFACE_MGMT=eth0
            INTERFACE_INT=eth1
            INTERFACE_EXT=eth2

            # ml2 network type drive, could be vlan, gre, vxlan.
            TYPE_DR=vlan
            # All Vlanid in vlan ranges used by tenant networks need to be
            # pre-configured on all switches connected with tenant networks.
            VLAN_RANGES=physnet1:1000:1100

            # Enable fortinet plugin, when ENABLE_FORTINET_PLUGIN, TYPE_DR only
            # support vlan
            ENABLE_FORTINET_PLUGIN=True
            FORTINET_ADDRESS=10.160.37.96
            FORTINET_EXT_INTERFACE=port9
            FORTINET_INT_INTERFACE=port1

            ###################################################

        c) Install Openstack controller on a host:
            ./ins.sh -v mitaka controller

        d) Install Openstack compute on other hosts:
            ./ins.sh -v mitaka compute

    Notes:
         If you are doing multi-modes installation, the suggested script run
         sequence is:
         1. prepare your fortigate (if have)
         2. Install controller
         3. Install others (compute/network)
